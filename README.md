# Program Overview
This Python program simulates a user's shopping experience in a supermarket. It allows the user to purchase items such as a lottery ticket, apples, cans of beans, and sodas. The program provides a welcome message and guides the user through the shopping process.

## How to Use
The program starts by displaying the available items and their prices.
The user is prompted to choose whether to purchase a lottery ticket.
If the user chooses to buy a lottery ticket, there is a 33% chance to win an amount between $2 and $10.
The user is then prompted to choose whether to purchase apples.
The program handles input errors and ensures that the user enters a valid integer for the number of apples.
Next, the user is asked if they want to buy cans of beans.
Similar to apples, the program handles input errors for the number of cans of beans.
Finally, the user is asked if they want to buy sodas.
Input errors for the number of sodas are also handled.
The program summarizes the user's purchases and displays the remaining money.

## Important Notes
The program uses random numbers to simulate winning the lottery.
Input errors are handled to ensure a smooth user experience.
The user's spending and remaining money are tracked throughout the shopping process.
